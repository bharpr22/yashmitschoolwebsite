"There are two things we should give our children: one is roots and the other is wings."

Our alumni continues to excel in various fields and this is as a result of our dedicated teachers and supporters. The creation of the Lilavatibai Podar Alumni Association will continue to propel our noble institution and its members in the right direction.

The Lilavatibai Podar Alumni Association is now a registered body and we hope that each and every Podarite will be a part of it. #PodaritesForLife

According to our Mission Statement and Goals defined in the charter, our aim is to preserve and promote fellowship among present and future alumni. Our long term goals will include building and strengthening our community relations. We also plan to continue to celebrate excellence in our students and provide incentives for their encouragement annually.

Let me hope that through this medium we will indeed forge life-long bonds with each other and become beacons of progress on a global scale.

We look forward to the continued participation of each of the members for the smooth governance of the association and our unbroken connection.
